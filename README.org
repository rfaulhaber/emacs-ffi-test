#+TITLE: emacs-ffi-test

Where I try to get Rust code to run in Emacs.

I borrowed code from [[https://github.com/jjpe/emacs_module_bindings][here]] and read [[https://mrosset.github.io/emacs-module/][this]] this.

This very naive module provides a feature to Emacs called =my-rust-mod= and a
function called =my-rust-fn=, which returns a string.

For reasons I don't understand, here are some issues:

- When compiled with =--release=, Emacs cannot load this module. It gives the
  error "Wrong type argument: symbolp, 1619370". I haven't figured out why
- Many of my own functions don't work. If you replace a call to =intern= with
  =intern_sym=, for example, where the latter does the same as the former, this
  code will cause a segfault
